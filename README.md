# 2D-Boids
2D Boids Simulation based on CW Reynolds paper on flocks.

Using three simple properties of flocks outline in CW Reynolds paper, seperation, alignment, and cohesion, I was able
to get some pretty neat coordinate movement. This was another short python project in the vein of simulation that I 
didn't find to be very difficult to code. 

The next step I plan take is to program a 3D version in unity.
